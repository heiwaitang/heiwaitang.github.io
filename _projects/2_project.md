After a long period of “easy” growth, the Hong Kong economy now lags behind the technological revolution led by the rapid adoption of IT and AI, and has lost some of its unique strengths in the global division of economic activities. Hong Kong faces a trio of aggregate, structural, and distributional problems. As economic growth slows down, business activities delivering mid-level incomes hollow out, and social inequalities widen. We propose the creation of a good-jobs city to simultaneously solve these problems.

The importance of creating more good jobs for Hong Kong is not yet well recognized. We clarify five myths with regard to job creation in Hong Kong. Overall, Hong Kong needs to increase industrial diversity, enlarge market size, and improve labor mobility. Instead of advocating drastic changes, we recommend gradual adjustments to enhance the financial sector, upgrade the service sector, and cultivate an emerging high-tech sector. These three sectors will be the basis of producing a large quantity of good jobs in Hong Kong.

We see the creation of good jobs as a result of relaxing resource constraints, improving gross economic inefficiency, and solving economic externalities. The Hong Kong government should not shy away from its role in leading the economic transition and facilitating the redistribution of jobs towards good industries. To help the government carry out this role, we make four concrete policy proposals involving talent strategy, public-private partnership in R&D investment, strategic cooperation with mainland cities, and leveraging the higher-education sector.

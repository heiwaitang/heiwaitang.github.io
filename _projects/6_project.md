Globalization is in its deepest crisis since World War II. The world has been deglobalizing for over a decade, starting with the end of the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis. Structural factors are partly to blame, including ageing and automation, but so are inward-looking protectionist policies supported by anti-globalizers around the world. Recent anti-globalization events, most notably Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war, expediated the trend. Above all, the Covid-19 pandemic, which already caused the largest economic contraction on record in many countries, has brought the global economy to its knees. Drawing insights from the two waves of globalization and deglobalization that have taken place since the mid-19th Century, this essay aims to shed light on the impact of the escalating U.S.-China tension and Covid-19 on globalization. It addresses both the short-run and long-run prospects of globalization, drawing on historical accounts and recent academic research.

In sum, the essay posits that globalization tends to progress fast under three necessary conditions. First, technological breakthroughs need to facilitate market integration. The steam engine and the Internet played this role as part of the first and second waves of globalization. Second, the leading power of the era—the U.K. during the first wave and the U.S. during the second—has to derive enough benefits from multilateralism to be motivated to support it. Third, globalization cannot generate too much within-country inequality. Unfortunately, all three conditions appear absent today.

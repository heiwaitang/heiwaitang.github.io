Hong Kong has ample experience and high efficiency in the professional services industry, as well as the advantages of a sound legal system, a good business environment, and the strength of basic research and development. While learning from overseas experience, Hong Kong should also make use of its own strengths to explore a unique development path. This report ends with 8 specific policy recommendations for the HKSAR government to consider, based on our country case studies and individual interviews with over 20 stakeholders and experts in Hong Kong and Shanghai:
1. Supporting IP-Backed Financing
2. Lowering the Costs and Risks of IP Valuation
3. Establishing an Alliance with a Secretariate to Pool Resources 
4. Strengthening Existing Legal and Regulatory Frameworks
5. Incentivizing Various Stakeholders in the IP Ecosystem
6. Building an IP Talent Pool
7. Joining and Building International Networks of IP Platforms
8. Governmentâ€™s Purchasing IP in Advanced Industries

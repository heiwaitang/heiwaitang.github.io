Does Hong Kong have the right conditions to be reindustrialised? Can companies with the right potential grasp the wave of reindustrialisation initiatives to facilitate the city’s long overdue third economic transformation? To shed light on these questions, this report aims to analyse the current performance and the future potential of three advanced manufacturing industries, in which Hong Kong is often perceived to have comparative advantages – FoodTech, GreenTech and HealthTech.

In collaboration with the HKU Business School, the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) conducted the “Reindustrialisation Study – Hong Kong” from July to September 2021 to explore the conditions, feasibility and challenges facing Hong Kong’s manufacturing firms in the three industries. Based on our own designed survey completed by 184 companies from these industries operating in Hong Kong, we identify the challenges facing manufacturers in Hong Kong, their major markets, their intention to implement Industry 4.0 technologies and difficulties encountered during the process, as well as their expectations about Hong Kong’s reindustrialisation. Besides studying these three sectors, we explore Hong Kong’s capacity to become one of the global semiconductor centres.

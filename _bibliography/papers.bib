  abstract={We study the financial implications of the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war for global supply chains.
    Around the dates when higher tariffs are announced, U.S. firms that depend more on exports to and
    imports from China experience larger declines in market value, with the negative effect spilling over to
    the affected firms’ suppliers and customers through production networks. The trade war effect is mainly
    concentrated among customers with low R&D intensity and suppliers outsourcing differentiated goods.
    We also exploit the within-firm variation in tariff exposure according to the detailed product lists and
    conduct a reverse experiment based on the 2019 trade talks. To explain the findings, we propose a
    theoretical model that highlights how complex trade structures shape shareholder wealth.},

abstract = {China's increased trade with, and investment in, Africa have boosted the continent's economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. The aggregate data on China's overseas direct investment (ODI) in African countries reveal that China's share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China's attraction to resource-rich countries is no different from Western investment. China's overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. Micro data from MOFCOM's database on registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012 provide a different perspective. Key words in project descriptions are used to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. Country-sector-level regressions based on firms' transaction-level data find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, like investment from other countries. In particular, regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments.},

statistical decision model in which a firm updates its prior belief about demand in a foreign market based on
several factors, including the number of neighbors currently selling there, the level and heterogeneity of their
export sales, and the firm's own prior knowledge about the market. A positive signal about demand inferred
from neighbors' export performance raises the firm's probability of entry and initial sales in the market but,
conditional on survival, lowers its post-entry growth. These learning effects are stronger when there are more
neighbors to learn from or when the firm is less familiar with the market. We find supporting evidence for the
main predictions of the model from transaction-level data for all Chinese exporters over the 2000-2006 period.
Our findings are robust to controlling for firms' supply shocks, countries' demand shocks, and city-country

abstract = {This paper analyzes how a firm's specialization in its core products after exporting affects its factor intensity and productivity. Using Chinese manufacturing firm data for the 1998–2007 period, we find that firms become less capital-intensive but more productive after exporting, compared to non-exporters that share similar ex ante characteristics. To rationalize these findings that contrast with existing studies, we develop a variant of the model by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) to consider firms producing multiple products with varying capital intensity. The model predicts that when a firm in a labor-abundant country starts exporting, it specializes in its core competencies by allocating more resources to produce more labor-intensive products. Firm ex ante productivity is associated with a smaller decline in capital intensity after exporting. A sharper post-export decline in capital intensity is associated with a larger increase in measured total factor productivity. We find firm-level evidence supporting these predictions. Using transaction-level data for the 2000–2006 period, we show that Chinese new exporters add products that are less capital-intensive than their existing products and drop those that are more capital-intensive in subsequent years.},

We first show that deterioration of relations between the United States and another country, measured by divergence in their United Nations General Assembly voting patterns, reduced U.S. imports from that country during 1962–2000. Though statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of political distance on trade is small. Indeed, we show that except for petroleum and some chemical products, U.S. imports are not affected by international politics. American firms, however, diversify their oil imports significantly away from political opponents of the United States. Oil trade is often associated with backward vertical foreign direct investment that is subject to the expropriation risk. In contrast to the usual claim that oil is a strategic commodity, we provide suggestive evidence that trade in products when rents are appropriable is more likely to be affected by international politics.},

Based on a variant of the Antràs-Helpman (2004) model, we show theoretically that control over imported components for assembly can affect firm integration decisions. Our empirical results show that when Chinese plants control the use of components, the export share of foreign-owned plants is positively correlated with the intensity of inputs provided by the headquarter (capital, skill, and R&D). These results are consistent with the property-rights theory of intra-firm trade. However, when foreign firms own and control the components, there is no evidence of a positive relationship between the intensity of headquarters' inputs and the prevalence of vertical integration. The results are consistent with our model that considers control over imported components as an alternative to asset ownership to alleviate hold-up by export-processing plants.},

In the model, labor market protection raises workers' incentives to acquire firm-specific skills relative to general skills, turning labor laws into a source of comparative advantage. In particular, the model shows that countries with more protective labor laws export relatively more in firm-specific skill-intensive sectors at both the intensive and extensive margins. To test the theoretical predictions, I construct sector proxies for the firm-specific and industry-specific skill intensity by estimating returns to firm tenure and industry tenure for different U.S. manufacturing sectors during the 1974–1993 period. By estimating sector-level gravity equations for 84 countries using the Helpman–Melitz–Rubinstein (2008) framework, I find evidence supporting the predicted effects of labor market institutions at both margins of exports.},

stopped serving the same country the following year. These rates are higher if the destination country is a market
with which Chinese firms are less familiar. We build a simple two-period model with imperfect information, in
which beliefs about their foreign demand are determined by learning from neighbors. In the model, a high
variance of the prior distribution of foreign demand induces firms to enter new markets. This is because the
profit function is convex in perceived foreign demand due to the option of exiting, which insures against the risk
of low demand realization. We then use our micro data to empirically examine several model predictions, and
find evidence to support the hypothesis that firms’ high entries and exits are outcomes of their rational selfdiscovery of demand in an unfamiliar market.},

Using a new, unique, and comprehensive dataset that covers close to 10,000 Chinese ODI deals from 1998 to 2009, we find that in contrast to the common perception, over half of the ODI deals are in service sectors, with many of them appearing to be export-related. In addition to documenting the pattern and trend of the PRC's ODI, we empirically examine both the determinants and effects of ODI at the firm level. We find that ex ante larger, more productive, and more export-intensive firms are more likely to start investing abroad. Using matching estimation techniques, we find that ODI is associated with better firm performance, including higher total factor productivity, employment, and export intensity, and greater product innovation. To assess the relative contributions of technology transfer, export promotion, and resource seeking to the positive effects of ODI, we use ODI data merged with customs transaction-level trade data. We find that firms’ ODI participation is associated with significantly better trade performance, measured by export and import volumes, export and import unit values, and number of export destinations. Contrary to perceived technology-seeking and resource-seeking motives, we find no evidence that ODI firms import more capital or intermediate inputs compared to non-ODI firms.},

A 10\% real appreciation of the renminbi is associated with a 1\% decline in the probability of entry, and a 0.2\% increase in the probability of exit. The effects among foreign-invested enterprises almost double for both entry and exit. Despite the seemingly large effect on the extensive margins, exchange rates alone can only explain about 4\% of entries and about 1.6\% of exits during the sample period. The exchange-rate elasticity of exports is estimated to be around 0.4 in the first year after the shock, with most of the adjustment taking place in the first 6 months. This finding of a relatively fast response to exchange rate shocks is consistent with anecdotal evidence about intense competition in the Chinese export sectors.},

abstract={We use transaction-level data for the universe of Chinese trading firms over 2000–2006 to document that
compared to ordinary exporters, export processing firms are larger but less diversified in products and
destinations within the same industry; start exporting larger volumes but grow less over time within
a market; are more likely to start selling to more distant markets but less likely to penetrate new ones
after the first year. Since EP firms face less uncertainty, these facts can be rationalized in light of the
heterogeneous-firm model with uncertainty in export sales, such as Fernandes and Tang (2014).},

subnational cross‐region export performance during 2019–2021. Using monthly export data at the product‐destination level for China's 31 provinces and municipality cities, we find that new infections in a region have a significantly negative effect on the region's export growth, particularly for non‐processing exports and industries with low dependence on remote working and products that are more substitutable and used mostly in the downstream of supply chains. However, restrictions on people inflows have no significant effect. The severity of the pandemic in export destinations is negatively correlated with China's export growth, suggesting an important demand‐side reason for China's export downturn during the pandemic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="trade_networks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Trade Networks and Firm Value: Evidence from the US-China Trade War</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://yihuang05.wixsite.com/macro" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Huang Yi</a>, <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/chen-lin/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Chen Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.siboliu.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Liu Sibo</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, April 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/trade_war_stock_jie.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We study the financial implications of the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war for global supply chains.

The trade war effect is mainly concentrated among customers with low R&amp;D intensity and suppliers outsourcing differentiated goods. We also exploit the within-firm variation in tariff exposure according to the detailed product lists and conduct a reverse experiment based on the 2019 trade talks.

They also generate cultural spillovers, as we find that domestic firms' female labor share increases with the prevalence of foreign affiliates in the same industry or city. Based on a multi-sector model that accounts for firm heterogeneity in productivity, gender bias, and learning, we perform counterfactual exercises.

To this end, we propose a method to estimate an extended input-output (IO) table that tracks inter-sector transactions between different types of firms in a domestic economy. The method is an application of constrained optimization, which relies on basic information from a country's national IO table, as well as sector- and firm-level data. We also propose a way to construct bootstrapped standard errors for any global value chain (GVC) measures estimated from the extended IO tables. We then use the extended IO table to study the domestic segment of GVC in China. We find that, not only is state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) domestic value-added to gross exports ratio much higher than those of other firms, but it also increased significantly from 1.2 in 2007 to 1.7 in 2010.

This article examines the presence of such biases in regulatory implementation, as revealed in the different actual value-added tax (VAT) incidence borne by foreign versus domestic firms. Using comprehensive Chinese manufacturing firm data, we find that within an industry, the de facto VAT rates facing foreign firms are on average 2 percentage points lower than those of domestic private firms. The finding of this “VAT discount” for foreign firms is robust to controlling for a host of firm characteristics and to using alternative definitions of foreign ownership. We rule out various economic motivations, such as the technology-seeking motive, and show indirect evidence that the ownership bias is intended to protect state-owned enterprises. Further research is needed to precisely pin down the underlying motivations and mechanisms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="ChenWenjie2018WICI" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Why Is China Investing in Africa?

The aggregate data on China's overseas direct investment (ODI) in African countries reveal that China's share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China's attraction to resource-rich countries is no different from Western investment. China's overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. Micro data from MOFCOM's database on registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012 provide a different perspective. Key words in project descriptions are used to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. Country-sector-level regressions based on firms' transaction-level data find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, like investment from other countries. In particular, regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="KeeHiauLooi2016DVAi" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Domestic Value Added in Exports: Theory and Firm Evidence from China</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/decrghiaulooikee/home" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Kee Hiau Looi</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="journal"> <em>American Economic Review</em>, 2016 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/dva_kee_tang.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>China has defied the declining trend in domestic content in exports in many countries. This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="FernandesAnaP.2014Ltef" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning to export from neighbors</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anafernandespage/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Fernandes Ana P.</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, 2014 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/learning_exp_tang_jie.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper studies how learning from neighboring firms affects new exporters' performance. We develop a statistical decision model in which a firm updates its prior belief about demand in a foreign market based on several factors, including the number of neighbors currently selling there, the level and heterogeneity of their export sales, and the firm's own prior knowledge about the market. A positive signal about demand inferred from neighbors' export performance raises the firm's probability of entry and initial sales in the market but, conditional on survival, lowers its post-entry growth. These learning effects are stronger when there are more neighbors to learn from or when the firm is less familiar with the market. We find supporting evidence for the main predictions of the model from transaction-level data for all Chinese exporters over the 2000-2006 period.

Using Chinese manufacturing firm data for the 1998–2007 period, we find that firms become less capital-intensive but more productive after exporting, compared to non-exporters that share similar ex ante characteristics. To rationalize these findings that contrast with existing studies, we develop a variant of the model by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) to consider firms producing multiple products with varying capital intensity. The model predicts that when a firm in a labor-abundant country starts exporting, it specializes in its core competencies by allocating more resources to produce more labor-intensive products. Firm ex ante productivity is associated with a smaller decline in capital intensity after exporting. A sharper post-export decline in capital intensity is associated with a larger increase in measured total factor productivity. We find firm-level evidence supporting these predictions. Using transaction-level data for the 2000–2006 period, we show that Chinese new exporters add products that are less capital-intensive than their existing products and drop those that are more capital-intensive in subsequent years.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="ChenWenjie2014TDIF" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Dragon Is Flying West: Micro-level Evidence of Chinese Outward Direct Investment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Chen Wenjie</em>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em> </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Asian Development Review</em>, 2014 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/adev_a_00032.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Outward direct investment (ODI) from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is surging. A common perception is that it was driven by the country's resource-seeking and technology-seeking motives. Using a new, unique, and comprehensive dataset that covers close to 10,000 Chinese ODI deals from 1998 to 2009, we find that in contrast to the common perception, over half of the ODI deals are in service sectors, with many of them appearing to be export-related. In addition to documenting the pattern and trend of the PRC's ODI, we empirically examine both the determinants and effects of ODI at the firm level. We find that ex ante larger, more productive, and more export-intensive firms are more likely to start investing abroad. Using matching estimation techniques, we find that ODI is associated with better firm performance, including higher total factor productivity, employment, and export intensity, and greater product innovation. To assess the relative contributions of technology transfer, export promotion, and resource seeking to the positive effects of ODI, we use ODI data merged with customs transaction-level trade data. We find that firms’ ODI participation is associated with significantly better trade performance, measured by export and import volumes, export and import unit values, and number of export destinations. Contrary to perceived technology-seeking and resource-seeking motives, we find no evidence that ODI firms import more capital or intermediate inputs compared to non-ODI firms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="MityakovSergey2013IPaI" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">International Politics and Import Diversification</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://myweb.fsu.edu/smityakov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mityakov, Sergey</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, <em>Tsui, Kevin K.</em> </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of Law &amp; Economics</em>, 2013 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/oil_jle.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper examines how international politics affects trade in the absence of empires or wars. We first show that deterioration of relations between the United States and another country, measured by divergence in their United Nations General Assembly voting patterns, reduced U.S. imports from that country during 1962–2000. Though statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of political distance on trade is small. Indeed, we show that except for petroleum and some chemical products, U.S. imports are not affected by international politics. American firms, however, diversify their oil imports significantly away from political opponents of the United States. Oil trade is often associated with backward vertical foreign direct investment that is subject to the expropriation risk. In contrast to the usual claim that oil is a strategic commodity, we provide suggestive evidence that trade in products when rents are appropriable is more likely to be affected by international politics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="FernandesAnaP.2012Dovi" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Determinants of vertical integration in export processing: Theory and evidence from China</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anafernandespage/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fernandes, Ana P.</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of Development Economics</em>, 2012 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/vi_ep_fernandes_tang.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper examines the determinants of vertical integration versus outsourcing in export processing, by exploiting the coexistence of two export processing regimes in China, which designate by law who owns and controls the imported components. Based on a variant of the Antràs-Helpman (2004) model, we show theoretically that control over imported components for assembly can affect firm integration decisions. Our empirical results show that when Chinese plants control the use of components, the export share of foreign-owned plants is positively correlated with the intensity of inputs provided by the headquarter (capital, skill, and R&amp;D). These results are consistent with the property-rights theory of intra-firm trade. However, when foreign firms own and control the components, there is no evidence of a positive relationship between the intensity of headquarters' inputs and the prevalence of vertical integration. The results are consistent with our model that considers control over imported components as an alternative to asset ownership to alleviate hold-up by export-processing plants.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TangHeiwai2012Lmif" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Labor market institutions, firm-specific skills, and trade patterns</div> <div class="author"> <em>Tang Heiwai</em> </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, 2012 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/jmp_0810.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper studies how a country's labor market institutions, by affecting workers' skill acquisition, can shape its export patterns.

In the model, labor market protection raises workers' incentives to acquire firm-specific skills relative to general skills, turning labor laws into a source of comparative advantage. In particular, the model shows that countries with more protective labor laws export relatively more in firm-specific skill-intensive sectors at both the intensive and extensive margins. To test the theoretical predictions, I construct sector proxies for the firm-specific and industry-specific skill intensity by estimating returns to firm tenure and industry tenure for different U.S. manufacturing sectors during the 1974–1993 period. By estimating sector-level gravity equations for 84 countries using the Helpman–Melitz–Rubinstein (2008) framework, I find evidence supporting the predicted effects of labor market institutions at both margins of exports.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TangHeiwai2012ERat" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exchange Rates and the Margins of Trade: Evidence from Chinese Exporters</div> <div class="author"> <em>Tang Heiwai</em> <a href="https://www.yifanzhang.net/" target="_blank">Zhang Yifan</a> </div> <div class="journal"> <em>CESifo economic studies</em>, 2012 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/exchange_margin_cesifo.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This article studies how real exchange rate movements affect firm export behavior, using monthly data that cover the universe of Chinese export transactions over the period of 2000-2006. Specifically, we examine exchange rate effects on an exporter's extensive (entry, exit, and product churning) and intensive margins of exports. We find significant effects on the extensive margin. A 10\% real appreciation of the renminbi is associated with a 1\% decline in the probability of entry, and a 0.2\% increase in the probability of exit. The effects among foreign-invested enterprises almost double for both entry and exit. Despite the seemingly large effect on the extensive margins, exchange rates alone can only explain about 4\% of entries and about 1.6\% of exits during the sample period. The exchange-rate elasticity of exports is estimated to be around 0.4 in the first year after the shock, with most of the adjustment taking place in the first 6 months. This finding of a relatively fast response to exchange rate shocks is consistent with anecdotal evidence about intense competition in the Chinese export sectors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="HuangYasheng2012FPiC" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FDI Policies in China and India: Evidence from Firm Surveys: FDI POLICIES IN CHINA AND INDIA</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://www.yashenghuang.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Huang Yasheng</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em> </div> <div class="journal"> <em>World Economy</em>, 2012 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/world_economy.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Research on China and India broadly agrees that these two countries have pursued widely different policies towards foreign direct investment (FDI).

A lesser known fact is that India has pursued comprehensive domestic reforms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <a id="bookchap"><h1>Book Chapters</h1></a> <hr style="color: var(--global-text-color); height: 1px; margin-bottom: 2rem;"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="CoulibalySouleymane2022AitN" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing Asia – Sub-Saharan Africa Global Value Chain Linkages</div> <div class="author"> <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, <em>Zeng Douglas Zhihua</em>, <em>Zeufack Albert G.</em> </div> <div class="bookchap"> <em>Africa in the New Trade Environment: Market Access in Troubled Times </em> edited by A.

Some of these Asian trading partners have lost their own growth momentum, and there have also been concerns that their economic engagement may have reduced Sub-Saharan African countries’ local industrial capability, causing them to be more dependent on Asian economies. For Sub-Saharan Africa to tap into the trade-and-growth spiral, it needs to diversify—away from some of the traditional high-income economy trading partners, whose growth is slowing, and away from commodity exports, which often exhibit high price volatility. The growing middle class in and increasing demand from Asia, especially East Asia, along with the shifting structure of global value chains (GVCs), may offer new economic opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa. This chapter assesses the value chain links between Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, summarizing the current status and future potential of African products in emerging Asia. The study offers insights on how the region’s economies can expand their market potential and advance their industrialization and economic diversification agendas.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TangHeiwai2003SARS" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How did the 2003 SARS epidemic shape Chinese trade?</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anafernandespage/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Fernandes, Ana P.</a> <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="bookchap"> <em>CEPR Covid Economics</em>, May 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/101374-covid_economics_issue_22.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper examines the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic on China's trade. Using quarterly transaction-level trade data of all Chinese firms, we find that firms in regions with local transmission of SARS experienced lower import and export growth at both the intensive and extensive margins, compared to those in the unaffected regions. The affected firms' trade growth remained lower two years after SARS. Products that are more capital-intensive, skill-intensive, upstream in the supply chains, and differentiated experienced a smaller export decline but a stronger recovery. Small exporters were more likely to exit, slowing down trade recovery.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="KasaharaHiroyuki2019Eeae" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Excessive entry and exit in export markets</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://hkasahar.arts.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Kasahara Hiroyuki</a> <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, </div> <div class="journal"> <em>Journal of the Japanese and International Economies</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/kasaharatang.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Using transaction-level data for all Chinese firms exporting between 2000 and 2006, we find that on average 78% of exporters to a country in a given year are new exporters. Among these new exporters, an average of 60% stopped serving the same country the following year. These rates are higher if the destination country is a market with which Chinese firms are less familiar. We build a simple two-period model with imperfect information, in which beliefs about their foreign demand are determined by learning from neighbors. In the model, a high variance of the prior distribution of foreign demand induces firms to enter new markets. This is because the profit function is convex in perceived foreign demand due to the option of exiting, which insures against the risk of low demand realization. We then use our micro data to empirically examine several model predictions, and find evidence to support the hypothesis that firms’ high entries and exits are outcomes of their rational selfdiscovery of demand in an unfamiliar market.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="Supplychainlinkages" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Supply chain linkages and financial markets: Evaluating the costs of the US-China trade war</div> <div class="author"> <em>Tang Heiwai</em>, <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/chen-lin/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Chen Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.siboliu.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Liu Sibo</a>, <a href="https://yihuang05.wixsite.com/macro" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Huang Yi</a> </div> <div class="bookchap"> <em>Trade War: The Clash of Economic Systems Endangering Global Prosperity</em> published by World Bank, 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/supply-chain-linkages-and-financial-markets-evaluating-costs-us-china-trade-war" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recent studies have found that US tariffs on China have led to a significant welfare loss and significant increases in consumer prices in the US. This column, taken from a recent Vox eBook, studies firms’ equity market responses to the various tariff announcements by the US and Chinese governments in 2018 and 2019. The responses demonstrate that the structure of US–China trade is much more complex than the simplistic view of global trade that prompted the trade war, and that the winners and losers in the war depend on firms’ positioning in, and exposure to, the global value chains shared by the two countries. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TradePatterns" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Trade Patterns and Dynamics of Processing Exporters: Evidence from China</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anafernandespage/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Fernandes Ana P.</a>, <em>Tang Heiwai</em> </div> <div class="bookchap"> <em>New Development in Global Sourcing</em> edited by Kohler Wilhelm Kohler and Yalcin Erdal, 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ep_dyn_fernandes_tang.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 waves-effect waves-light" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We use transaction-level data for the universe of Chinese trading firms over 2000–2006 to document that compared to ordinary exporters, export processing firms are larger but less diversified in products and destinations within the same industry; start exporting larger volumes but grow less over time within a market; are more likely to start selling to more distant markets but less likely to penetrate new ones after the first year. Since EP firms face less uncertainty, these facts can be rationalized in light of the heterogeneous-firm model with uncertainty in export sales, such as Fernandes and Tang (2014).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.21.4/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?acdb9690d7641b2f8d40529018c71a01"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c9d9dd48933de3831b3ee5ec9c209cac" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
